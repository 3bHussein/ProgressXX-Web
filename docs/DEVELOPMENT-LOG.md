# ProgressX — Development Log (Persistent)

This is the **append-only** chronological log of completed work, investigations, releases and handoffs. Last updated: **2026-10-11**.

## Rules — mandatory for all future tasks

1. Before work: read `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/PROJECT-HANDOFF.md`, **this log**, recent commits/PRs and Actions.
2. After **every** completed change or investigation, append a new dated entry here; never silently rewrite/delete historical entries. Update `docs/PROJECT-HANDOFF.md` with **current state / next action**, and update `ROADMAP.md` statuses and evidence where applicable.
3. Each entry MUST record: date (UTC preferred), scope, source/target files, what changed, commit/PR, tests and CI links/results, deployment status, data migration impact, known risks, and **exact next step**. If untested or not deployed write `NOT VERIFIED`; never claim a pass without evidence.
4. Update tracking files **as part of the task**, ideally in the same PR as code; if CI runs after the commit, append a follow-up verification entry when confirmed.
5. Never log secrets, real health data, personal workout/food exports, credentials or private user information in this public repository.
6. Only production target is `https://3bhussein.github.io/ProgressXX-Web/` (root `index.html`). Do not switch to `commercial-v1.html`.
7. If a task cannot be completed, log the blocker and continue in the next chat from the recorded step. Do not mark incomplete work as finished.

## Latest handoff snapshot

- **Stage:** Pre-release hardening; not certified for sale/public paid launch.
- **Known risk:** Real-account reproduction of login `undefined.filter` and Food/Daily restored-data sync needs independent confirmation, even though earlier CI ran green.
- **Primary next step:** Audit two-account Supabase RLS isolation plus per-account Food/Daily/Workout/Weight CRUD/sync; user confirms app working and Pages CI #38156792995 passed.
- **Data safety:** Preserve all existing user records; do not wipe or silently replace records.
- **Deployment URL:** https://3bhussein.github.io/ProgressXX-Web/
- **Repository:** https://github.com/3bHussein/ProgressXX-Web

## Entries (newest first)

### 2026-10-11 — Login regression CI confirmed green; user confirms app works

- **Confirmation:** User reported the application works after the prior restored-account test assertion correction.
- **Automated evidence:** [Deploy ProgressXX Full App run #38156792995](https://github.com/3bHussein/ProgressXX-Web/actions/runs/38156792995) completed **SUCCESS** for commit `d7d8d0b5a8eba7a4e7e5f2271165417df5354371`.
- **Scope:** Status verification and project documentation only; no application files, database schema or user records changed in this entry.
- **Remaining risk:** User confirmation and mocked CI do not establish complete multi-user authorization, live restored-data parity, or all-device sync correctness.
- **Next:** Audit Supabase table ownership/RLS and verify Food, Daily, Workout and Weight CRUD/sync for two independent test accounts; add negative authorization tests before paid launch.


### 2026-10-11 — Fix restored-account regression fixture count mismatch

- **Observed CI failure:** restored Food/Daily login test returned `hidden=true`, `entries=33`, `reminders=3`, `problems=[]` but expected 32 entries.
- **Finding:** Test snapshot explicitly contains one `local-test` workout record **plus** 32 mocked `legacy_workout_entries` records. Correct combined expected count is 33, not 32. This is a test-fixture mismatch, not evidence of a production account error.
- **Code changed:** `tests/login-imported-archive-regression.cjs` now expects `workouts.length + 1` and separately checks the local fixture appears exactly once, while still rejecting browser errors.
- **Commit:** `d7d8d0b5a8eba7a4e7e5f2271165417df5354371`.
- **Tests/deploy:** Updated GitHub Actions run is pending; must inspect actual outcome before marking pass. No production app, schema or user data changed.
- **Next:** Verify rerun of mandatory Pages workflow. If passing, audit account-isolated Food/Daily/Workout/Weight tables and RLS; separately confirm real restored-account login.


### 2026-10-11 — Fix hanging restored Food/Daily login CI regression

- **Symptom:** Pages deploy #38155895490 stayed in progress on `Required restored Food and Daily account login regression` after prior login UI regression succeeded.
- **Root-cause hypothesis:** Failure handler in `tests/login-imported-archive-regression.cjs` set `process.exitCode=1` but left Playwright Chromium running; a thrown assertion could keep Node alive until job timeout, masking the error. Confirm actual failing assertion from next CI log; this is a hang fix, not proof the underlying regression passes.
- **Files changed:** `tests/login-imported-archive-regression.cjs`, `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.
- **Commits:** `0750b4f069d89ebe024ffe334ac3b72e52afc054` (fail fast on error with stack); `7f49a6756edd8566dc5b5544628c79c41a9c07dc` (re-run deployment validation when either mandatory login test changes).
- **Tests/CI:** GitHub run on latest workflow commit pending verification. Do **not** mark pass until required regression and Pages deploy complete.
- **Deployment/data impact:** Test/CI only. No application data or schema touched; deploy remains gated.
- **Risk:** Actual mock-account test may fail even after hanging process is fixed; test quality and real Supabase two-user isolation remain unverified.
- **Next:** Inspect latest Pages CI run, capture first failing assertion; fix genuine login hydration bug without disabling tests, then proceed to Food/Daily/Workout/Weight RLS audit.


### 2026-10-11 — Make login regression checks mandatory for Pages deploy

- **Scope:** CI deployment gate for existing login recovery tests (not an application behavior change).
- **File changed:** `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.
- **Commit:** `2297115beebb3014b2c693682c7bd971b285fb5e`.
- **Change:** After existing mobile smoke test, require `node tests/login-optional-render-recovery.cjs` and `node tests/login-imported-archive-regression.cjs` to pass before Pages artifact upload/deploy. Restored Food/Daily login tests were previously present but not explicitly called by deploy workflow.
- **Tests:** As of logging, [deployment run #38155895490](https://github.com/3bHussein/ProgressXX-Web/actions/runs/38155895490) and [full-UI smoke #38155895425](https://github.com/3bHussein/ProgressXX-Web/actions/runs/38155895425) were QUEUED — **NOT VERIFIED**, must inspect final conclusions.
- **Deployment/data:** No database or user data changes; deployment of workflow update pending CI.
- **Risk:** Tests use mocked account responses, not a live Supabase two-user/RLS verification. Existing tests must actually pass in CI. A real restored account may still exhibit the prior exception.
- **Next:** Inspect queued CI results; on failure diagnose/fix without bypass. Then test two-account RLS isolation and audit Food/Daily persistence.


### 2026-10-11 — Persistent development log and future-chat continuity

- **Scope:** Documentation/process only; no application code or data modified.
- **Files:** `docs/DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md`; README and handoff documentation cross-links/rules.
- **Change:** Introduced append-only development history, mandatory per-task closeout checklist, persistent last-known state and explicit next step for future chats.
- **Commit:** See GitHub history for this documentation change.
- **Tests/CI:** Documentation checked by re-fetch from GitHub; no functional test implied. Any triggered CI must be inspected separately.
- **Deployment/data impact:** No intended runtime, schema or user-data changes.
- **Risks:** The log only updates when future contributors actively commit new entries; it is not a background auto-logger.
- **Next step:** Verify `undefined.filter` login regression on live deployed root site with safe restored-account test, then map Food/Daily sync and RLS.

### 2026-10-11 — Initial README, roadmap and handoff created

- **Scope:** Documentation baseline for future chats.
- **Files:** `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/PROJECT-HANDOFF.md`.
- **Commits:** `cab205f8ac2795bcee2b9376b61d48a269111880`, `062d2861f7ba05eb8611b1dd8037ddd02994f2a7`, `09c28192fa1bfa2d26027ad0df4c8a82b383d160`.
- **Tests/CI:** Document files fetched and confirmed present; no functional production certification.
- **Deployment/data impact:** No application changes.
- **Known risk:** Security and end-to-end persistence not yet certified.
- **Next step:** Phase 0/1 in ROADMAP; investigate restored-account login regression first.

### 2026-10-11 — Last observed application regression commit (historical observation)

- **App commit:** `f2ee3f45562ded0c5ac7f2037625c438ad521b94`: login Food/Daily `undefined.filter` crash regression with restored archive fixtures (#15).
- **Observed CI:** [Full ProgressXX migration smoke #38154374844](https://github.com/3bHussein/ProgressXX-Web/actions/runs/38154374844) — success.
- **Observed deploy:** [Deploy ProgressXX Full App #38154374610](https://github.com/3bHussein/ProgressXX-Web/actions/runs/38154374610) — success.
- **Caution:** Fixtures and CI cannot prove every real account is fixed. Recheck latest runs each new session.
- **Next step:** Test real restored account + distinct user data isolation and compare with current production state.
